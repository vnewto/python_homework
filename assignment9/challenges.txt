This was definitely a difficult assignment. I struggled the most with Task 3 because it was all new to me. Extracting the data was confusing and I couldn't figure out why it was returning to me different types of data such as WebElements when I was expecting a list, or a single item when I was expecting a list. One of those issues was because I was using find_element instead of find_elements. Additionally I struggled with when I was able to use the .text on a returned object. I used lots of print statements and trial and error.

I also got many errors that said "Path does not exist" when trying to figure out the XPath situation. I found a good set of tutorial videos on YouTube that helped explain how to write an XPath and that was very useful. He explained the difference between the single slash and double slash, as well as what XPaths were, which conceptually I had not really understood.  I got frustrated when it took me a really long time to figure out why my XPath was giving me values from elsewhere on the page even though I had only searched the parent element, and ended up asking ChatGPT why my code wasn't working. It turns out I was just missing a period in front of the XPath, which is what tells the code to navigate up to the parent, then back down again. 

All in all, I would say it was a tough lesson but it was very fun and exciting. This topic is so interesting to me. It's something I never thought I'd be able to do, but I feel very satisfied with having figured it out.
